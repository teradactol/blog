Decision tables are a tool to elegantly model complex rule sets 
and their corresponding actions, essentially, aiding in the 
formulation of requirements when dealing with complex business rules.

To demonstrate, we are going to work with a simple scenario for 
a job application system.

> A person would like to apply for a job opportunity. One of the business 
rules for the system is that for the application to be submitted, 
it must be valid. For an application to be valid, it must either have 
a cv attached or be endorsed by a respected referrer.

The steps to constructing the decision table representing 
the above scenario are as follows:

## `Step 1 :`

Analyze the requirement to extract the conditions and resulting actions 
and create the first column

> Requirement : ”Application is submitted if it has a cv attached or if
it’s endorsed”

The conditions and resulting actions should expressed in a way that they
can either be `TRUE` or `FALSE` (though this can be altered depending on
the scenario). 

In the this case there are two conditions;

* The application has a cv is attached, `cv is attached`.
* The application is endorsed, `is endorsed`.

And one resulting action; 

* The application is submitted, `application submitted`.
